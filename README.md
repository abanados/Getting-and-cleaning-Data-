# Getting-and-cleaning-Data-
The course proyect include a script called run_analysis.R, and after loading the data set "UCI HAR Dataset" the following steps were performed:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Finally, two data were obtained, the first "tidydata" that considers the instructions contained in the first four steps, "datafinal" that is a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
