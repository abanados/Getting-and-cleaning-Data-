Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

#The project will use the data based on a Dataset (URI HAR Dataset) , which are:
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt
- subject_test.txt

And use features.txt, and activity_labels.txt; the first contains the variable name of each column 
of x_train.txt and x_test.txt, and the second contains desciptive names for each activity label, 
which corresponds to each number in the y_train.txt and y_test.txt

#The README.txt it includes the requirements that must be met to complete the project.

After of creating the script "run_analysis.R" using the data.table package conteined in URI HAR Dataset, 
the following steps must be completed:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TIDY DATA SET

Finally in the script run_analysis.R we obteined two data set.

- The first is "tidydata", who contains 10299 observations and 88 variables after complete the four first steps. 
In this data the first column refers to each subject that did the experiment, column 2 to 87 are the feature variables
(mean and std of the whole feature variables), the last column is refers to the activity that the subjects were doing, They are:
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

- The second data is "datafinal", who contains 180 observations and 88 variables after going through all 5 steps of the course project. 
The first column is the subject id, second column is the activity and the rest are the average of each feature variables.
